# KipTool
This repository is currently only used for the releases of KipTool.

The sources for the Application have not yet been migrated from the [ImagingSuite Repository](https://github.com/neutronimaging/imagingsuite/tree/master/applications/kiptool).

The easiest way to compile the application from source is to follow the build instructions for imaging suite.
